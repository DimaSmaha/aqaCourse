/** TASK - Working with Arrays
 *
 * 1. Declare an array "fruits" and assign it a list of at least five different fruits.
 *
 * 2. Use a for loop to iterate through the array and output each fruit to the console.
 *
 * 3. Use an if statement inside the loop to check if the fruit is "Apple":
 *    - If true, output "Apple found!" instead of the fruit name.
