/** TASK - Using the Increment (++) Operator in Playwright
 *
 * 1. Create a Playwright test.
 *
 * 2. Declare a variable using `let` and update its value using the `++` operator.
 *
 * 3. Use Playwright actions to interact with a webpage.
 *
 * 4. Perform assertions to verify expected behavior.
 *
 * ðŸ’¡ **Clue:** Create a test where we have a counter that is 0 at the start and then it increments, each time we add an item
