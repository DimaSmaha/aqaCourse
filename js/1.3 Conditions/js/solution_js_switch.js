/** TASK - Using Switch to Determine the Current Month
 *
 * 1. Get the current month as a number using the new Date() (1 for January, 2 for February, etc.).
 *
 * 2. Use a switch statement to:
 *    - Output a message like: "Currently, it's March, the 3rd month of the year."
 *
 * 3. Handle all 12 months.
 *
 * 4. Ensure the output dynamically adjusts based on the actual current month.
 *
 * ðŸ’¡ **Clue:** Create a dynamic variable monthName to later pass it into the sentence
