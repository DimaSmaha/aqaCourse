/** TASK - Using an If Statement in a Playwright Test
 *
 * 1. Create a Playwright test.
 *
 * 2. Use an `if` statement to check a condition during the test.
 *
 * 3. Perform different actions based on whether the condition is true or false.
 *
 * 4. Use assertions to verify the expected behavior.
 *
 * ðŸ’¡ **Clue:** Try checking if a number (e.g., item count, score, or displayed value) meets a condition before performing an action.
