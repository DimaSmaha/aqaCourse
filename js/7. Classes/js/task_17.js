/** TASK 17 - Class Inheritance and Method Overriding
 *
 * 1. Create a class Car with properties: brand, model, and year.
 *    - Add a method displayInfo, that logs car details.
 *    - Add a method startEngine, that outputs to the console that engine is started
 *
 * 2. Create a class ElectricCar that inherits from Car.
 *    - Add a new property batteryLevel.
 *    - Override the displayInfo, method to also include batteryLevel, use super to call the method from parent cclass.
 *    - Call the parent class's displayInfo inside the overridden method.
 *
 * 3. Create instances of both classes and call displayInfo on them.
 *
 * 4. Call the startEngine method using both instances. Why we have access to the parent method from child class?
